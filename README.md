# MyCareer

An old project dated 2019.

A simple text based Basketball Simulator, where you pose as the manager. It is based on C++, has simple encryption and decryption for login and logout,
saves progress each time. The game ends when you win the NBA Title. 

The game features 6 teams, who you will have to beat to win the game. It also has interactive cuts and story mode.
The simulator based off the player's performance on that year's NBA games, imported from the ESPN website.
